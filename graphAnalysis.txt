It takes the algorithm 14 iterations to calculate 105 digits of PI. At n=1, the algorithm quickly converges on pi, producing '3.141592' accurately. At this point, error quickly decreases to a microscopic percentage. By looking at the graph later in time when N = 2, the error then increases (for some reason) before reaching its final value of roughly 1.438E-14, which I consider to be the average percetage of error for this tool although it cannot be checked as no furthur digits of PI have been calculated with 100% certainty.
